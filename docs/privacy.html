                <p>
                    This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (Google). Google Analytics
                    uses cookies, i.e. text files stored on your computer to enable analysis of website usage by you.
                    Information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a
                    Google server in the United States and stored there. In case of activated IP anonymization on this
                    website, however, your IP address is previously truncated by Google within member states of the
                    European Union or in other states which are party to the agreement on the European Economic Area.
                    Only in exceptional cases is a full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the United States
                    and truncated there. On behalf this website's owner, Google will use this information to evaluate
                    your use of the website, compile reports about website activities, and provide the website's
                    operator with further services related to website and Internet usage. The IP address sent from your
                    browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other data by Google. You can prevent storage
                    of cookies by appropriately setting your browser software; in this case, however, please note that
                    you might not be able to fully use all functions offered by this website. In addition, you can
                    prevent data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP
                    address) from being collected and processed by Google, by downloading and installing a browser
                    plug-in from the following link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>

                <h3>Social plug-ins from Facebook</h3>
                <p>
                    We use social plug-ins from facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo
                    Alto, CA 94304, USA. The plug-ins can be recognized by way of the Facebook logo or the supplement
                    "Facebook Social Plug-in". For example, if you click on the "Like" button or leave a comment, the
                    relevant information is transmitted directly from your browser to Facebook and stored there.
                    Furthermore, Facebook makes your likes public for your Facebook friends. If you are logged into
                    Facebook, it can assign the invocation of our page directly to your Facebook account. Even if you
                    are not logged in or don't have a Facebook account, your browser sends information (e.g. which web
                    pages you have called up, your IP address) which is then stored by Facebook. For details about
                    handling of your personal data by Facebook and your related rights, please refer to the data privacy
                    policy of Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php. If you do not want Facebook to map data
                    collected about you via our Web sites to your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before
                    you visit our web pages.

                <h3>Social plug-ins from Twitter</h3>
                <p>
                    With Twitter and its Retweet functions, we use social plug-ins from Twitter.com, operated by Twitter
                    Inc. 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107. If you use Retweet, the websites visited by
                    you are announced to third parties and associated with your Twitter account. Details about handling
                    of your data by Twitter as well as your rights and setting options for protecting your personal
                    information can be found in Twitter's data privacy policy: http://twitter.com/privacy
                </p>

                    According to the Federal Data Protection Act, you have a right to free-of-charge information about
                    your stored data, and possibly entitlement to correction, blocking or deletion of such data. Contact
