        "description": "GestureMap is a visual analytics tool that directly visualisesa space of gestures as an interactive 2D map, using a Variational Autoencoder. We evaluated GestureMap and its concepts with eight experts and an in-depth analysis of published datasets. Our findings show how GestureMap facilitates exploring large datasets and helps researchers to gain a visual understanding of gesture spaces. It further opens new directions, such as comparing users' gesture proposals across many user studies. We discuss implications for gesture elicitation studies and research."
