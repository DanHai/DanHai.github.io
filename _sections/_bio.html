<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
    I am Hai Dang, currently a doctoral researcher at the University of Bayreuth in Germany. I'm part of the
    <a href="https://www.hciai.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html">ZD.B. junior research group: HCIAI</a>
    where I'm advised by <a href="http://daniel-buschek.de/intro">Dr. Daniel Buschek.</a>
    Before this, I completed my bachelors degree in media informatics and masters degree in computer science at
    the University Munich in Germany.
</p>
<p>
    My research interests include machine learning, deep learning and human computer interactions.
    I build interpretable interactive systems to generate creative artifacts
    from algorithms in ways that are not possible with traditional input methods.
